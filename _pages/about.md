<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently enrolled in a Master's program for Electrical Science and Technology at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering (ÁîµÂ≠ê‰ø°ÊÅØ‰∏éÁîµÊ∞îÂ∑•Á®ãÂ≠¶Èô¢), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, and under the supervision of Professor [Guanghui He](https://dmne.sjtu.edu.cn/dmne/faculty/heguanghui/). 

My current research interests are at the intersection of autonomous driving system, digital circuits and computer architectures. The current focus is efficient ASIC design for AI applications like object detection, point cloud processing and NeRF (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lsL91dsAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

[A Broad-Spectrum and High-Throughput Compression Engine for Neural Network Processors](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433078)

**Yuzhou Chen**, Jinming Zhang, Dongxu Lyu, Zhenyu Li, Guanghui He

- a broad-spectrum and high-throughput compression engine for feature maps (fmap) with software-hardware co-design.
- It also demonstrates substantial throughput boost (4$\sim$128x) and compression ratio improvement over the state-of-the-art fmap compression engine while providing superior support of both CNN and Transformer fmaps.

[O$^3$NMS: An Out-Of-Order-Based Low-Latency Accelerator for Non-Maximum Suppression](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10181731)

**Yuzhou Chen**, Jinming Zhang, Dongxu Lyu, Xi Yu, Guanghui He
- A novel non-maximum suppression (NMS) accelerator that enables ultra-low-latency NMS processing. 
- Compared with the state-of-the-art accelerators, our FPGA implementation achieves 2.51x speedup and our ASIC implementation achieves 3.65x speedup.
