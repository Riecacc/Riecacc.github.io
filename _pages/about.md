<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently enrolled in a Master's program for Electrical Science and Technology at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering (ÁîµÂ≠ê‰ø°ÊÅØ‰∏éÁîµÊ∞îÂ∑•Á®ãÂ≠¶Èô¢), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, and under the supervision of Professor [Guanghui He](https://dmne.sjtu.edu.cn/dmne/faculty/heguanghui/). 

My current research interests are at the intersection of autonomous driving system, digital circuits and computer architectures. The current focus is efficient ASIC design for AI applications like object detection, point cloud processing and NeRF (<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lsL91dsAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

[A Broad-Spectrum and High-Throughput Compression Engine for Neural Network Processors]()

**Yuzhou Chen**, Jinming Zhang, Dongxu Lyu, Zhenyu Li, Guanghui He

- A grid-based feature learning network accelerator with algorithm-architecture co-optimization for large-scale point clouds. 
- It also demonstrates substantial performance boost over the state-of-the-art point cloud accelerators while providing superior support of large-scale point clouds ($>10^6$ points in $\sim$2ms).
- **An extension of our DAC'24 paper**.
